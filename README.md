This is going to be an attempt to create a machine learning algorithm to predict whether or not a stock is worth buying based on a "meta score"

### Installing

### Libraries
I will be using most everything from [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)


##Notes
This is my first machine learning project and first decent sized python project so there might be some situations where best practices are not followed but I am learning and will adopt best practices as I learn them.
