# Stock Elo Trading Algorithm
This is going to be an attempt to create a machine learning algorithm to predict whether or not a stock is worth buying based on a "elo score". When looking to buy a stock on may use indicators the help such as MacD, RSI, Bollinger Bands etc. I believe we are subconsciously
creating an algorithm to make that split buy/sell decision. The result of the algorithm is what I call the Elo score and I am trying to discover how that score is calculated.

### Installing
1. First create a folder for this project
2. Use your command line of choice to navigate to the folder. I am using [cmder](http://cmder.net/)
3. Once you are in your folder you dedicated to the project you are going to then use the command: ```git clone https://github.com/Cantum2/StockMetaScore.git```
4. Now add the project folder in to your editor of choice
5. Great you should have everything installed!

### Some useful tools:
Their are thousands of wonderful tools in the world for projects like these! I am using which are not required I just found them useful:
1. [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/): The editor of choice for this project
2. [cmder](http://cmder.net/): This is a command line for windows that has a lovely UI


### Libraries/Tools
1. I will be using most everything from [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
2. [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/)

## Notes
This is my first machine learning project and first decent sized python project so there might be some situations where best practices are not followed but I am learning and will adopt best practices as I learn them.
